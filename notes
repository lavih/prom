# Best practices notes:
- pin the image version and dont pull from latest - bugs prone
- bind mount to host as persistent volumes
- the Graphite container runs more than pid 1 process
- run as non-root user
- the deployment should be implemented using Ansible or other appropriate tool and not using ssh bulk
- enter all the variables as ENV variables to keep the code dynamic
